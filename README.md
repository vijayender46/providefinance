### Starting the App

In your cloned repository, from the project directory, run:

#### `npm start`

This action will open up our test application in your web browser. (Be warned - the application is in a broken state, and your task will be to fix it.)

This README contains a series of tasks which involve fixing bugs and adding features to this application.
Please complete these tasks in their given order, and commit the solutions to each task as individual commits. You are advised to refer to the task number in your commit message.

Once completed, please share your cloned repository with us.

Best of luck!

## Overview of the Application

This application is a basic E-Commerce interface created with create-react-app. 

The application enables a user to browse products and add them to a basket.

Once the products have been added to the basket, the user can checkout their shopping basket and view the total cost of their order.

- `/products` - Shows a list of available products to a user.
- `/checkout` - Displays the user's shopping basket items, the total order value, and allows the user to place the order.

## Tasks

### Task 1 - Fix the Routing

The routes described above are currently not functional. If you run `npm start`, an error will be presented due to the inability to navigate routes such as `/products`. Your task is to debug and rectify this issue.

### Task 2 - React State Management

On the `/products` route, a list of products should be displayed.

Each product should have an 'Add to basket' option that can be clicked to add the product to the shopping basket.
The current shopping basket items and their total price should be visible at the top of the page.

A checkout button should be available to proceed to the `/checkout` page.

However, there exists an issue â€” once the application navigates to the `/checkout` page, the shopping basket gets emptied and the user is left with nothing to order.

These items need to persist across all pages (including `/checkout`) to ensure that the user does not lose the items in their basket when the pages change.

Use your knowledge of React state management to resolve this issue. Consider options such as the Context API, Redux, etc.

We would like you to be abe to discuss your reasoning behind your chosen solution.

Additionally, please implement a confirmation message to notify users when their order gets successfully placed.
(Note: The order doesn't need to be saved; this is merely a dummy confirmation.)

### Task 3 - Making Improvements

You may have noticed that when you click 'Add to basket' multiple times for a product, its entries get duplicated in the shopping cart.

Please resolve this issue by increasing the quantity of the product rather than adding a new entry whenever it is added to the basket multiple times.

### Task 4 - Component Creation

By now, you should have a working E-Commerce system! Users can browse products and confirm their orders using the now functional shopping basket.

However, the product's details are not comprehensive.

We would like you to add a new route `product/{id}` to display detailed information about the product.

Users should be able to click a 'View Detail' button on each product listed on the `/products` page.

For more information, have a look at the API being used to list the products; this will give you an idea of the information available for display on the product detail page.

### Task 5 - Feature Implementation

Each product returned from the API has a 'discount' property, which is currently not being utilised in the application.

Please add a new feature to the `Cart` component, which calculates a new 'Total price' using the products discount value.

This updated total should be shown next to the original total and reflect the total price after applying discounts.
